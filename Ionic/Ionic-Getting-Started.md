Ionic: Getting Started

What is Ionic ?
> Framework to create hybrid web applications including PWA and desktop app with the help of electron.

- Ionic uses capacitor which was developed by ionic which is similar to cordova.
- Capacitor is a tool that wraps the ionic code into a web view, which is then seen as native application. (web-> Native mobile)
- Ionic CLI can be used with angular CLI and build workflow which is easy to create, relaod, bundling and optmising applications.
- With latest version of Ionic which is Ionic4, the community has developed web components which can be used by any framework.
